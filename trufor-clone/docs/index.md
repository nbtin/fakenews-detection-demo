**TruFor** is a forensic framework that can be applied to a large variety of image manipulation methods, from classic cheapfakes to more recent manipulations based on deep learning. We rely on the extraction of both high-level and low-level traces through a transformer-based fusion architecture that combines the RGB image and a learned noise-sensitive fingerprint. The latter learns to embed the artifacts related to the camera internal and external processing by training only on real data in a self-supervised manner. Forgeries are detected as deviations from the expected regular pattern that characterizes each pristine image. Looking for anomalies makes the approach able to robustly detect a variety of local manipulations, ensuring generalization. In addition to a pixel-level **localization map** and a whole-image **integrity score**, our approach outputs a **reliability map** that highlights areas where localization predictions may be error-prone. This is particularly important in forensic applications in order to reduce false alarms and allow for a large scale analysis. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method is able to reliably detect and localize both cheapfakes and deepfakes manipulations outperforming state-of-the-art works. 

The training is divided into three separate phases:

## Architecture

<center> <img src="./architecture.png" alt="architecture" width="80%" /> </center>

We cast the forgery localization task as a supervised binary segmentation problem, combining high-level (**RGB**) and low-level (**Noiseprint++**) features using a cross-modal framework.

## Noiseprint++

**Noiseprint++** is a learned noise residual. It is an improvement of our previous work [Noiseprint](https://grip-unina.github.io/noiseprint/). It can e seen as a fingerprint that captures traces related to the camera model and the editing history of the image.
When an image is forged, the Noiseprint++ enhances inconsistencies between authentic and tampered regions.

## Confidence

To reduce the impact of false alarms, we estimate a confidence map using TCP as a confidence criterion.

## Qualitative results

Errors in the anomaly map are corrected by the confidence map, drastically improving the final detection score.
